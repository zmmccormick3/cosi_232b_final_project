query_results.txt
- ran query_script.py
- 50 neuroscience questions: 10 systems, 10 electrophysiology, 10 computational, 10 cognitive, 10 clinical
- just gave top 5 articles relevant to the prompt; no response generation

query_results_1.txt
- ran full_response_generation.py
- 50 neuroscience questions: 10 systems, 10 electrophysiology, 10 computational, 10 cognitive, 10 clinical
- FLAN-T5 model for generation but only one-sentence responses
  - do_sample=False (greedy decoding; always picking most probable next word)
  - no temperature
  - max_length = 200

query_results_2.txt
- ran full_response_generation.py
- 50 neuroscience questions: 10 systems, 10 electrophysiology, 10 computational, 10 cognitive, 10 clinical
- FLAN-T5 model for generation
  - increased max_length; max_length = 500
  - added "Write a detailed multi-sentence answer to the query below, based on the context" before query generation
  - changes do_sample; do_sample = True
  - temperature = 0.7 (to give a little randomness and pick less obvious next tokens)
  - top_p = 0.9
  - so: result = generator(prompt, max_length=500, do_sample=True, temperature=0.7, top_p=0.9)
